Tomaterminal: The Pomodoro timer inside your terminal
================================================================================
Tomaterminal is a terminal program based on the Pomodoro (Italian for Tomato) method of working. In the Pomodoro method, you take a timer ((frequently tomato shaped) historically used in kitchens) and you set a 25 minute timer for work. After 25 mintues are completed, you set a 5 minute timer for break. Tomaterminal emulates this exact behavior, alerting you after 25 minutes have elapsed, then after your 5 minute break has elapsed.
